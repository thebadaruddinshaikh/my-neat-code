# Problem Solving Tips. - WIP

1. When you are first presented with the question, **calmly** read the question.
   Grasp as much information you possibly can. I know it is hard but, BUT stop
   your brain from shooting off in different directions with different possible
   solutions At this step you are only required to understand what the question,
   solving will come at a later step, I promise. If you are in an interview
   setting it is strongly recommended to take a sample test case and explain
   your understanding if you are missing something, your interviewer will step
   in to correct you. At this step you will have a strong shared understanding
   of the problem at you have now officialy graduated to the next step.

2. It is completely okay to take a pause and think about the a possible
   approach, and if you have gone through this guide or done NeetCode 250, you
   will have a hunch. AGAIN - Do not rush towards a solution, They do not want
   someone to regurgiate the most optimal solution they want to see how you
   solve a problem. First have a higher level understanding of a possible
   solution. Okay so at the end of this step you have overview of a solution.

3. Now that you have an overview of your solution, now is the time to think of
   the datastructures the variables you might need , how and why will you add
   things to your datastrucutres and how and why you will update your variables.
   This is good point to jot down your pseudo code highlevel. If you write
   python it is very tempting to just start writing code, do please do me a
   favor and dont. You will write code, Patience young padawan.
