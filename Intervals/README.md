Lets talk about the interval problems, where you are given start and end times
of what represent intervals. Usually at the heart of the problem is around
overlaps. We obviously find overlaps using two for loops but this doesnt really
work for problems with a large input size, and this precisely is the tricky part
of this type of problems.
