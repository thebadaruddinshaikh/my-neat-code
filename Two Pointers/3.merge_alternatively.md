# Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings, word1 and word2. Construct a new string by merging
them in alternating order, starting with word1 â€” take one character from word1,
then one from word2, and repeat this process.

If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters from the
longer string to the end of the merged result.

Return the final merged string.

## Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "xyz"
Output: "axbycz"
```

**Explanation:** Merge alternately: a + x + b + y + c + z = "axbycz"

---

## Example 2:

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "abbxxc"
Output: "aabbbxxc"
```

**Explanation:** word1 is shorter, so append remaining characters from word2.

---

## Example 3:

```
Input: word1 = "abcdef", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcdef"
```

**Explanation:** word2 is shorter, so append remaining characters from word1.

---

## Constraints:

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        ans = [""] * (len(word1) + len(word2))

        i = 0
        j = 0
        k = 0

        while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
            if i < len(word1):
                ans[k] = word1[i]
                i+=1
                k+=1
            if j < len(word2):
                ans[k] = word2[j]
                j += 1
                k += 1

        return "".join(ans)

```
