# Reverse String

You are given an array of characters which represents a string s. Write a
function which reverses a string.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = ["n","e","e","t"]
Output: ["t","e","e","n"]
```

---

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = ["r","a","c","e","c","a","r"]
Output: ["r","a","c","e","c","a","r"]
```

---

## Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length < 100,000
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            s[l] , s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l+=1
            r-=1

        return s
```
