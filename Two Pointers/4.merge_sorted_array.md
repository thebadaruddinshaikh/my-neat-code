Merge Sorted Array You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both sorted
in non-decreasing order, along with two integers m and n, where:

m is the number of valid elements in nums1, n is the number of elements in
nums2. The array nums1 has a total length of (m+n), with the first m elements
containing the values to be merged, and the last n elements set to 0 as
placeholders.

Your task is to merge the two arrays such that the final merged array is also
sorted in non-decreasing order and stored entirely within nums1. You must modify
nums1 in-place and do not return anything from the function.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [10,20,20,40,0,0], m = 4, nums2 = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [1,2,10,20,20,40] Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [0,0], m = 0, nums2 = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [1,2] Constraints:

0 <= m, n <= 200 1 <= (m + n) <= 200 nums1.length == (m + n) nums2.length == n
-1,000,000,000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1,000,000,000
