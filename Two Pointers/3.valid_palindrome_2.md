# Valid Palindrome II

You are given a string s, return true if the s can be a palindrome after
deleting at most one character from it.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aca"
Output: true
```

**Explanation:** "aca" is already a palindrome.

---

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abbadc"
Output: false
```

**Explanation:** "abbadc" is not a palindrome and can't be made a palindrome
after deleting at most one character.

---

## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "abbda"
Output: true
```

**Explanation:** We can delete the character 'd'.

---

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 100,000
- s is made up of only lowercase English letters.

```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return self.test(s, 0, len(s)-1, 1)


    def test(self, s, l, r, count):
        if l >= r:
            return True

        if s[l] != s[r]:
            if count == 0:
                return False
            else:
                return self.test(s, l+1, r, count - 1) or \
                self.test(s, l, r-1, count - 1)

        else:
            return self.test(s, l+1, r-1, count)

```
