# What's this repo?

The point of this repo, document and help aid myself and anybody in preparing
for technical interviews to build intutition. If you have attempted OA's or sat
for interview after the launch of LLM's you are well aware that the complexity
of questions as risen significantly and the idea of "memorising solutions" will
no longer work. Hence the need of building that problem solving muslces is
absolutely necessary.

# Contributions.

Currently the repo is closed off to accepting external contributions, as at the
time of writing this Readme, is for me to build the intuition, this might change
over the course of time, if that does happen this part will be deleted from the
Readme.

# Use of AI.

Well building the problem solving muscle requires you to not rely on support
wheels, that's AI. The only contribution AI has/will have is as a formatter or
proof reader, and sometimes not even that.
