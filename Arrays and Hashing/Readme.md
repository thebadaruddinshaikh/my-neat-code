# Arrays and Hashing.

1D data structure. Most question will require some kind of remembering and or
Travesal techniques.

It is a remembering question when the answer to the question you are trying
solve depends on some sort of information ahead of you from the current position
or behind you. Most commons ways that you would remember this information is by
using some sort of data structure. Below are the commonly used datastructures
for "remebering". Depending on the problem we either use one or a combination.

- Hashtable
- HashSet
- Prefix Array
- Suffix Array
- Heap
- Bitmap
- Stack / Monotonic Stack

Its a traversal type question when the array some how find the longest subarray
where a condition is met
