# Final Price With a Special Discount in a Shop

A shopkeeper arranges items in a list for a sale. Starting from the left, each
item is sold at its full price minus the price of the first item to its right
that is of equal or lower price. If no such item exists, the item is sold at its
full price. Print the sum of the final cost for all items, then on the next
line, print space-separated list of integers based on indices of items that are
sold at full price, in ascending order.

For example, consider the item prices [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2].

- Item at indices 0 and 1 are each discounted by 1 unit, the first equal or
  lower price to their right.
- Item at index 2 is not discounted as there are no equal or lower-priced items
  to its right.
- Item 3, priced at 2 units, is discounted by 2 units to 0.
- Item 4, priced at 4 units, is discounted by 2 units to 2.
- The final item, priced at 2 units, is sold at full price as there are no items
  to its right.

The total cost amounts to 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 8 units, with full price items
at indices [2, 5] using 0-based indexing. The output is:

```
8
2 5
```

Complete the function `finalPrice` in the editor with the following
parameter(s):

- `int prices[]`: an array of item prices

second line, print a space-separated list of integers representing the indices
of items purchased at full price, in ascending index order.
