# 739. Daily Temperatures

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to
wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day
for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

**Explanation:**

- On day 0 (73°), the next warmer day is day 1 (74°), so we wait 1 day.
- On day 1 (74°), the next warmer day is day 2 (75°), so we wait 1 day.
- On day 2 (75°), the next warmer day is day 6 (76°), so we wait 4 days.
- On day 3 (71°), the next warmer day is day 5 (72°), so we wait 2 days.
- On day 4 (69°), the next warmer day is day 5 (72°), so we wait 1 day.
- On day 5 (72°), the next warmer day is day 6 (76°), so we wait 1 day.
- On day 6 (76°), there is no warmer day, so we wait 0 days.
- On day 7 (73°), there is no warmer day, so we wait 0 days.

## Example 2:

```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

---

## Example 3:

```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

---

## Constraints:

- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temp: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * len(temp)
        stack = []

        for i in range(len(temp) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and temp[i] >= stack[-1][1]:
                stack.pop()

            if stack:
                ans[i] = (stack[-1][0] - i)
            else:
                ans[i] = (0)

            stack.append((i,temp[i]))

        return ans
```
