# Arrays and Hashing.

Arrays are simple datascturctures , one Dimensional (some questions will require you to deal with 2D arrays), and since there isn't a lot of complexity in the
way the data is stored, question here will usually require some mental
gynastics. Most question will require some kind of remembering and or Travesal
techniques. Often with array question there is a brute force solution which is very straight forward, then the optimiszation expeteced are with time and space. In most interviews you will face arrays , since the tricky questions really need you to know 

It is a remembering question when the answer to the question you are trying
solve depends on some sort of information ahead of you from the current position
or behind you. Most commons ways that you would remember this information is by
using some sort of data structure. Below are the commonly used datastructures
for "remebering". Depending on the problem we either use one or a combination.

- Hashtable
- HashSet
- Array - (Prefix, Suffix, Bucketing)
- Heap
- Bitmap
- Stack / Monotonic Stack


**Sorting**
1. Bubble Sort. 
2. Insertion Sort. 
3. Merge Sort. 
4. Heap Sort. 
4. Quick Sort. (+Randomized)
5. Bucket Sort. 
6. Radix Sort. 

**Searching**
1. 1D binary Search.
2. 2D binary Search. 

**Traversing**
1. Two Pointers. 
2. Sliding Window



Its a traversal type question when the array some how find the longest subarray
where a condition is met
