# 15. 3Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

**Explanation:**

- nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
- nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
- nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
- The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
- Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not
  matter.

---

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
```

**Explanation:** The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

---

## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
```

**Explanation:** The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

---

## Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

## Solution

The biggest pitfall when it comes to problem solving is pushing on a pattern you
have previously seen to a new question that has a similar wording (or if you are
practicing a, similar name). For instance at the time of writing this document,
the my first attempt at this problem was to blindly apply 2 sum but in a slighly
modified way.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        hmap = defaultdict(list)
        hset = set()

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            hmap[num].append(i)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                target = -(nums[i] + nums[j])
                if target in hmap:
                    for k in hmap[target]:
                        if i != k and j != k:
                            hset.add(tuple(sorted([nums[i],nums[j],nums[k]])))
        return [list(t) for t in hset]
```

The Time Complexity of this program still is O(N<sup>3</sup>). This happens when
the entire array is one element. And naturally this fails.
