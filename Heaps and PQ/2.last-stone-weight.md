# Last Stone Weight

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the
weight of the ith stone.

We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

1. At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash
   them together
2. If x == y, both stones are destroyed
3. If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has
   new weight y - x.
4. Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.

## Example 1:

```
Input: stones = [2,3,6,2,4]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

- We smash 6 and 4 and are left with a 2, so the array becomes [2,3,2,2].
- We smash 3 and 2 and are left with a 1, so the array becomes [1,2,2].
- We smash 2 and 2, so the array becomes [1].

## Example 2:

```
Input: stones = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

---

## Constraints:

- `1 <= stones.length <= 20`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-n for n in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            first = -heapq.heappop(stones)
            second = -heapq.heappop(stones)

            diff = abs(first-second)

            if diff > 0:
                heapq.heappush(stones, -diff)


        return -stones[0] if stones else 0
```
