# K Closest Points to Origin

You are given a 2-D array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the
coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. You are also given an integer `k`.

Return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points is defined as the Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 -
x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).

You may return the answer in any order.

## Example 1:

```
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[0,2]]
```

**Explanation:**  
The distance between (0, 2) and the origin (0, 0) is 2.  
The distance between (2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = 2.82842.  
So the closest point to the origin is (0, 2).

## Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2]], k = 2
Output: [[0,2],[2,0]]
```

**Explanation:**  
The output `[[2,0],[0,2]]` would also be accepted.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 1000`
- `-100 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 100`

## Solution

```python
import heapq
import math

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        dist = []

        for i, p in enumerate(points):
            heapq.heappush(dist, (math.dist([0,0], p), i))

        ans = []
        for _ in range(k):
            _, i = heapq.heappop(dist)
            ans.append(points[i])

        return ans
```
