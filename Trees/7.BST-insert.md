# Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes
from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a
tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a
descendant of itself.

## Example 1:

![](./images/2025-07-18-21-08-03.png)

```
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8
Output: 5
```

---

## Example 2:

![](./images/2025-07-18-21-08-15.png)

```
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant
of itself.

## Constraints:

- 2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- p != q
- p and q will both exist

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(val)

        if val <= root.val:
            if root.left:
                self.insertIntoBST(root.left, val)
            else:
                root.left = TreeNode(val)
        else:
            if root.right:
                self.insertIntoBST(root.right, val)
            else:
                root.right = TreeNode(val)

        return root
```
