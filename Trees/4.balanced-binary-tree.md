# Balanced Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy

---

Given a binary tree, return true if it is height-balanced and false otherwise.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and
right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

## Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
Output: true
```

---

## Example 2:

![](2025-07-18-10-11-41.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,null,5]
Output: false
```

---

## Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Solution

1. What do I want from the either arm? - Height
2. When I make the recursive call how am I going to use the information that I
   got from the my call ot the other arm. Store
3. When recursive calls to both arms have finished, what information am I
   passing to the parent? -> if the tree is blanced
4. How does the current node contribute to this information I am building. 1 +
   height

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        balance, _ = self.helper(root)
        return balance

    def helper(self, node):
        if not node:
            return True , 0

        lb, lh = self.helper(node.left)
        rb, rh = self.helper(node.right)


        if lb and rb:
            return abs(lh-rh) <=1, max(lh,rh) +1

        return False, -1
```
