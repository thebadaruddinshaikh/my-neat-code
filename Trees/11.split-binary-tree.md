# Split Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree with at least one node and checks
if that Binary Tree can be split into two Binary Trees of equal sum by removing
a single edge. If this split is possible, return the new sum of each Binary
Tree, otherwise return 0. Note that you do not need to return the edge that was
removed.

The sum of a Binary Tree is the sum of all values in that Binary Tree.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /   \
    3    -2
   / \   / \
  6  -5 5   2
 /
2
```

```
Output: 6
```

**Explanation:** Remove the edge to the left of the root node, creating two
trees, each with sums of 6.

---

## Constraints:

- The input tree is a binary tree where each node has an integer value
- The tree will have at least one node
- Node values can be negative, positive, or zero

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None`/

## Solution

```python
def splitBinaryTree(tree):
    treeSum = total(tree)

    found = None
    if treeSum % 2 == 0:
        found , _ = findSplit(tree, treeSum // 2)

    return found if found else 0
    # Write your code here.

def findSplit(node, target):
    if not node:
        return None, 0

    found, left = findSplit(node.left, target)
    if found:
        return found, None

    found, right = findSplit(node.right, target)

    if found:
        return found, None

    found = left if left == target else None
    found = right if right == target else found

    return found, left + right + node.value

def total(node):
    if not node:
        return 0

    left = total(node.left)
    right = total(node.right)

    return node.value + left + right
```
