# Find Nodes Distance K

You're given the root node of a Binary Tree, a `target` value of a node that's
contained in the tree, and a positive integer `k`. Write a function that returns
the values of all the nodes that are exactly distance `k` from the node with
`target` value.

The distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges that must be
traversed to go from one node to the other. For example, the distance between a
node and its immediate left or right child is `1`. The same holds in reverse:
the distance between a node and its parent is `1`. In a tree of three nodes
where the root node has a left and right child, the left and right children are
distance `2` from each other.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input:
tree =    1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \     \
     4   5     6
        / \
       7   8
target = 3
k = 2

Output: [2, 7, 8]
```

**Explanation:** These values could be ordered differently.

---

## Constraints:

- The input tree is a binary tree where each node has an integer value
- All node values will be unique
- The target value is guaranteed to be in the tree
- k >= 1

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None`/

## Solution

The solution to this problem can be broken down into the following steps.

1. Finding the node in the tree.
2. From this Node we want to be able to walk k steps in all possible directions,
   left child, right child and the parent.
3. Since this tree doesn't store access to the parents , we could use a
   dictionary to store parents all of all the nodes.
4. P.S This is also a good place to talk about how to generate an adjacency List
   from a Tree.

```python
def findNodesDistanceK(tree, target, k):
    parents = {tree.value: None}
    buildParent(tree, parents)
    print(parents)
    node = findNode(tree, target)

    ans = []
    visited = set()
    findKNodes(node, k , ans, parents, visited)
    return ans


def findKNodes(node, k , ans, parents, visited):
    if not node:
        return

    if node.value in visited:
        return

    if node and k == 0:
        ans.append(node.value)
        return

    visited.add(node.value)
    findKNodes(parents[node.value], k-1, ans, parents, visited)
    findKNodes(node.left, k-1, ans, parents, visited)
    findKNodes(node.right, k-1, ans, parents, visited)



def findNode(node, target):
    if not node:
        return None

    if node.value == target:
        return node

    left = findNode(node.left, target)
    if left:
        return left

    right = findNode(node.right, target)
    if right:
        return right

    # Write your code here.


def buildParent(node, parents):
    if node.left:
        parents[node.left.value] = node
        buildParent(node.left, parents)
    if node.right:
        parents[node.right.value] = node
        buildParent(node.right, parents)
```

### Solution using Adjacency List

```python
def findNodesDistanceK(tree, target, k):
    # Write your code here.
    adjList= {tree.value:[]}
    buildAdjList(tree, adjList)

    visited = set()
    queue = deque([])

    visited.add(target)
    for n in adjList[target]:
        visited.add(n.value)
        queue.append((1, n))

    ans = []
    while queue:
        level, node = queue.popleft()
        if level == k:
            ans.append(node.value)
        else:
            for v in adjList[node.value]:
                if v.value not in visited:
                    visited.add(v.value)
                    queue.append((level+1, v))

    return ans


def buildAdjList(node, adjList):

    if node.left:
        adjList[node.value].append(node.left)
        adjList[node.left.value] = [node]
        buildAdjList(node.left, adjList)


    if node.right:
        adjList[node.value].append(node.right)
        adjList[node.right.value] = [node]
        buildAdjList(node.right, adjList)

```
