# Branch Sums

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch
sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum.

A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch. A Binary Tree
branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any
leaf node.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /   \
     2     3
   /  \   /  \
  4    5 6    7
 / \  /
8   9 10

Output: [15, 16, 18, 10, 11]
```

**Explanation:**

- 15 == 1 + 2 + 4 + 8
- 16 == 1 + 2 + 4 + 9
- 18 == 1 + 2 + 5 + 10
- 10 == 1 + 3 + 6
- 11 == 1 + 3 + 7

---

## Constraints:

- The input tree is a binary tree where each node has an integer value
- The tree can have any number of nodes (including 0)
- A node's value can be any integer

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None`/

## Solution

This questions is interesting because this puts a fork in the road for us. All
this while the technique we have been employing is called Bottom up Approach.
This question here produces an a better solution (Space usage wise). Before we
do a Top Down approach lets first see if we can write write a Bottom up solution
using our questions.

1. What do I want from the either arm?
   - an array of all the element sum with all its branches
2. When I make the recursive call how am I going to use the information that I
   got from the my call ot the other arm.
   - Just save
3. When recursive calls to both arms have finished, what information am I
   passing to the parent?
   - Combining the array of the two
4. How does the current node contribute to this information I am building.
   - Adding itself to all the elements in the combined array returned from the
     two arms.

```python
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


def branchSums(root):
    # Write your code here.
    if not root:
        return []

    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return [root.value]


    left = branchSums(root.left)

    right = branchSums(root.right)

    return [i+ root.value for i in left+right]

```

**Time Complexity :** O(N) <br> **Space Complexity :** O(N) <br> **Stack Space
Complexity:** O(N)

We are passing arrays back to the parent, which isn't the most ideal.

Lets see if we can a better solutin with Top-Down approach.

```python
# This is the class of the input root. Do not edit it.
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


def branchSums(root):
    # Write your code here.
    ans = []
    helper(root, 0, ans)
    return ans

def helper(node, acc, ans):
    if not node:
        return

    if not node.right and not node.left:
        ans.append(acc+node.value)

    helper(node.left, acc+node.value, ans)
    helper(node.right, acc+node.value, ans)

```
