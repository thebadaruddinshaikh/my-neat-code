# Compare Leaf Traversal

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

Write a function that takes in the root nodes of two Binary Trees and returns a
boolean representing whether their leaf traversals are the same.

The leaf traversal of a Binary Tree traverses only its leaf nodes from left to
right. A leaf node is any node that has no `left` or `right` children.

For example, the leaf traversal of the following Binary Tree is `1, 3, 2`.

```
      4
     / \
    1   5
       / \
      3   2
```

---

## Example 1:

```
Input:
tree1 = 1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   /
   4   5 6
      / \
     7   8

tree2 = 1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   7 5   6
        / \
       8   6

Output: true
```

**Explanation:** Both trees have the same leaf traversal: [4, 7, 8, 6]

---

## Example 2:

```
Input:
tree1 = 1
      /   \
     2     3
    /
   4

tree2 = 1
      /   \
     2     3
          /
         4

Output: false
```

**Explanation:** First tree has leaf traversal [4], while second has [4, 3]

---

## Constraints:

- The input trees are binary trees where each node has an integer value
- The trees can have any number of nodes
- A node's value can be any integer

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None`/`null`.

## Solution

```python
def isLeaf(node):
    return node.left is None and node.right is None

def treeTraverse(node, arr):
    if not node:
        return

    if isLeaf(node):
        arr.append(node.value)
        return

    treeTraverse(node.left, arr)
    treeTraverse(node.right, arr)


def compareLeafTraversal(tree1, tree2):
    # Write your code here.
    trav1 = []
    trav2 = []

    treeTraverse(tree1, trav1)
    treeTraverse(tree2, trav2)

    if len(trav1) != len(trav2):
        return False

    for a,b in zip(trav1, trav2):
        if a != b:
            return False

    return True
```
