# Node Depths

**Difficulty:** Easy

---

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the
node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes'
depths.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \ / \
   4  5 6  7
  / \
 8   9

Output: 16
```

**Explanation:**

- The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
- The depth of the node with value 3 is 1.
- The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
- The depth of the node with value 5 is 2.
- Etc...
- Summing all of these depths yields 16.

---

## Constraints:

- The input tree is a binary tree where each node has an integer value
- The tree can have any number of nodes (including 0)

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None

## Solution.

Usually when a single value is returned from a tree it usually is a bottom up
approach, But this is _not_ the case here and for a reason we will talk in a
minute. You see the depth from the root is used, hence the information is
flowing downards from the tree. But Information is also being combined (sum of
depths of children). This question here would use a hybrid approach.

- What Information is going down the tree?
  - Distance from the parent
- What information is being passed up?
  - Sum of depths of childrens

```python
def nodeDepths(root):
    return helper(root, 0)

def helper(node, dist):
    if not node:
        return 0

    left = helper(node.left, dist + 1)
    right = helper(node.right, dist + 1)

    return dist + left + right
```
