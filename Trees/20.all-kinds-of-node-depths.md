# All Kinds Of Node Depths

**Difficulty:** Hard

---

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the
node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of all of its
subtrees' nodes' depths.

---

## Example 1:

```
Input:
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7
 / \
8   9

Output: 26
```

**Explanation:**

- The sum of the root tree's node depths is 16.
- The sum of the tree rooted at 2's node depths is 6.
- The sum of the tree rooted at 3's node depths is 2.
- The sum of the tree rooted at 4's node depths is 2.
- Summing all of these sums yields 26.

---

## Constraints:

- The input tree is a binary tree where each node has an integer value
- The tree can have any number of nodes (including 0)
- A node's value can be any integer

---

## Note:

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or

```python
def helper(node, height):
    if not node:
        return 0

    left = helper(node.left, height + 1)
    right = helper(node.right, height + 1)

    return left + right + sum(range(1, height+1))


def allKindsOfNodeDepths(root):
    return helper(root, 0)
```
