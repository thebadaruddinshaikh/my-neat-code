# Recursion.

This is a super important topic. Mastering recursion is almost like unlocking a
super power as a programmer. Primarily becuase there are plethora of problems
that can be solved elegantly using recursion AND I personally think recursion
knowing how to write recursive solution is a first step towards mastering
Dynamic Programming.

The categories of problem that you'd encouter are but not limited to the
following:

1. Formula Based :
   - The answer you seek can be found by combining answers to the same question
     but to a smaller input. And you know the answer to this question when the
     input gets small enogh.
2. Processing a nested Datasctucture.
   - You will be given a set of rules on how to process this datastructure. How
     to combine this datasctructure when you find an instance of nesting.
